				When the days are cool<br/>
				And the cards are fold<br/>
				And the saints we see are all made of gold.<br/><br/>

				When your dreams all fail<br/>
				And the ones we hailed are the worst of all<br/>
				And the blood's run stale.<br/><br/>

				I want to hide the truth, I wanna shelter you<br/>
				But with the beast inside, there nowhere we can hide<br/>
				No natter what we breed, We still are made of greed<br/>
				This is my kindom come, This is my kindom come.<br/><br/>

				When you feel my heat, Look into my eye<br/>
				Is where my demons hide, is where my demons hide<br/>
				Don't get too close, its dark inside<br/>
				Is where my demons hide, is where my demons hide<br/><br/>

				At the curtain's call is the last of all<br/>
				When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl<br/>
				So the dug your grave, and the masquerade <br/>
				will come calling out at the mess you made<br/><br/>

				Don't wanna let you down, but I'm hell bound<br/>
				though this is all for you, <br/>
				I don't want to hide the truth<br/>
				No natter what we breed, We still are made of greed<br/>
				This is my kindom come, This is my kindom come.<br/><br/>

				When you feel my heat, Look into my eye<br/>
				Is where my demons hide, is where my demons hide<br/>
				Don't get too close, its dark inside<br/>
				Is where my demons hide, is where my demons hide.<br/><br/>

				They said it's what you make,  I say it's up to fate<br/>
				It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go, <br/>
				Your eyes, they sine so bight, I wanna say their <br/>light
				I can't escape this now, unless you show me how<br/><br/>

				When you feel my heat, Look into my eye<br/>
				Is where my demons hide, is where my demons hide<br/>
				Don't get too close, its dark inside<br/>
				Is where my demons hide, is where my demons hide<br/><br/><br/>
